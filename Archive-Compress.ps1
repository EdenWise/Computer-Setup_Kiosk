## ARCHIVE CREATE FROM LISTS (INCLUSIONS AND EXCLUSIONS) AND WITH UPDATE CAPABILITIES (USING 7ZIP).
#
# List of Excludes requires using relative paths if archiving non-root. Also avoid using generic
# names as 7zip excludes has the ability for general matching (like "Downloads" will match 
# "Music\Downloads").
#
# 7zip (and almost all other archiving programs that I know of [MS-Zip, tar...]) lacks being able to
# archive links (soft links, hard links, and junctions): MS-Zip fails to do them; .7z fails to do
# them AND junctions get copied as directories (which can make for LARGE archives); 7-zip's WIM works
# some with symbolic links but can have extraction problems (junctions are created as a blank file, and hard-links are copied); and tar only works on a Linux-like filesystem. Using `dism.exe` works and
# is a nice container solution, however it does require administrative rights and I lack knowing
# if it works good with lists (made more for disk copies). 'wimlib' works and can be used be a regular
# user but I have yet to find out how to do it with lists. In short, links are best removed from
# archive and then recreated after extraction.

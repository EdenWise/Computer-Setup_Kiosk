Many Computer Kiosks reset daily (i.e. lab computers) but allow some customization. These scripts setup some basic options and application environment (program manager and archive creation). 

These scripts require Powershell to run. The easy way for me to start Powershell is by typing in the search box (*Type here to search*):

    conhost powershell.exe
